# obsytwidget

- To be used with [Tuna](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/tuna.843/), using this instead of the default widget
- SHADERS are not included with tuna, get them with [ShaderFilter](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-shaderfilter.1736/)
- Background is also not included, make a new Color Source behind the widget and give it shaders
  - OR just [edit the css and enable the background there](https://github.com/xamionex/obsytwidget/blob/main/obsytwidget.css#L16)
- [Visualizer can be found here](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/waveform.1423/), the way I have it it has color correction filter with opacity at 0.5
- Everything else is configured within OBS, I set my width to 1500 and height to 280, experiment with what fits your scene best
