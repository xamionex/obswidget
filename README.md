# obsytwidget

- To be used with [Tuna](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/tuna.843/), using this (petarwidget.html) instead of the default widget
- [Visualizer can be found here](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/waveform.1423/), the way I have it it has color correction filter with opacity at 0.5
- Everything else is configured with the config.ini file or within obs

## Configuration

- There is not much to be configurated unless you want to customize the widget look, you should look at the config.ini file unless you want to customize everything yourself
 in that case you should make a file called style.css, it will be imported automatically
- If you want to edit the script. I suggest you edit the file directly, it's for the best
