# obsytwidget

- To be used with [Tuna](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/tuna.843/), using this (petarwidget.html) instead of the default widget
- [Visualizer can be found here](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/waveform.1423/), the way I have it it has color correction filter with opacity at 0.5
- Everything else is configured within OBS, I set my width to 1520 and height to 282, experiment with what fits your scene best

## Configuration

- There is not much to be configurated unless you want to customize the widget look, in that case you should make a file called style.css, it will be imported automatically
- If you want to edit the script. I suggest you edit the file directly, it's for the best
